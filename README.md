I've created this repository to follow some learning process.

It helped me to learn how to use TypeScript and MongoDB.

### Why TypeScript?
- TypeScript is rising in popularity, so it will be good for chasing overseas jobs.
- Avoid the JavaScript errors, like undefined...
- Make the code easy to refactor and maintain.

### Why MongoDB?
- It's a NoSQL database. *i suck at many relationships* -**toimprove**
- **It's open source.**
- It's user-friendly.
- It's a document-oriented database.
- It's a key-value database.

So it's a json-like database, and it's good for microservices.
And I like json :grin:

### Why Node.js?
- Well, Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

## Disclaimer
My opinion can change over the years. 

I'm not here dictate the future.

It's just a learning process, I like those technologies and will use my free time to learn more.
